\chapter{Resource Allocation}

Here we will show the resources assignment to each task identified in the previous chapter.
Of course, this is only a simualtion, the development and deployment phase will never start.
This is just a possbile way to split the work between the components of our group, even if we think that a project like this should be handled by more than just two persons. In fact, when there are more than two tasks simultaneously the resource allocation is highlighted in blue and this means that that resource is overworking to compensate the lack (just an example to show what happens when there are many simultaneous tasks).
In order to mantain th readability again, we split the diagrams for each rescource (the components of our group).
